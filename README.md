# Can-t-add-arguments-and-variables
So i'm making a life tracker and the idea is everyday if its been good i add 50 and if not i add -50, it should then compare my value to some people i look up to and compare mine to what i need to get into certian schools. Im not sure why but in my function, I cant add the argument (either 50 or -50) to my overall progress (variable).
